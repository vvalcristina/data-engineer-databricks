## [Apache Spark Programming with Databricks](https://github.com/vvalcristina/data-engineer-databricks/tree/main/Apache-Spark-Programming-with-Databricks)

In this course you will start by visualizing and applying Spark architecture concepts in example scenarios. Then, you will explore and preprocess datasets by applying a variety of DataFrame transformations and actions. After ingesting data from various file formats, you will apply these preprocessing steps and write them to Delta tables. The case study then expands to stream from Delta in an analytics use case that demonstrates core Structured Streaming concepts. Lastly, you will explore the Spark UI and how query optimization, partitioning, and caching affect performance.
